Instruction guide
The steps are as follow: 
    a. Copy the test images to the source code folder.
    b. Open the file “mainProcess” with Matlab. 
    c. Click Run. The similarity between realTraceMap and simulatedTraceMap1 will be calculated.
    d. Replace the 7th line with “I{2} = imread('simulatedTraceMap2.bmp');”.
    e. Click Run. The similarity between realTraceMap and simulatedTraceMaps will be calculated.
In addition, the images have been preprocessed. The algorithm will determine whether simulatedTraceMap1 or simulatedTraceMap2 is more similar to realTraceMap.
